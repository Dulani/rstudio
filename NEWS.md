## RStudio 1.5 "Ghost Orchid" Release Notes

### Logging

* In an effort to help make the RStudio Team products more cohesive, logging has been changed significantly.
* By default, server logs will now be written to file instead of syslog. Warnings and errors will still log to syslog. This can be controlled by the `warn-syslog` parameter in `logging.conf`.
* By default, server logs will now be written under `/var/log/rstudio/rstudio-server`.
* Logs can now be written in JSON lines format.
* Reloading the logging.conf configuration by sending a SIGHUP to the `rserver` process will now cause all RStudio managed subprocesses to also refresh their logging configuration.
* Logging can now be partially configured using environment variables (`RS_LOGGER_TYPE`, `RS_LOG_LEVEL`, `RS_LOG_MESSAGE_FORMAT`, and `RS_LOG_DIR`).
* Log files will now rotate by time in addition to the existing rotation by file size. This can be controlled by the `rotate-days` parameter in `logging.conf`.
* For more information, see section 2 of the Admin Guide.
